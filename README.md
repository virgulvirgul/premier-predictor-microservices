## Introduction

Premier League 18/19 predictor app, designed for users to correctly predict all the scores for the 18/19 Premier League to score points, as well as creating mini-leagues to compete with friends. Users can also check live match scores and stats.

## Technical Details

- This is built using the Ionic framework, with back-end APIs written in Kotlin using Spring Boot.
- The back-end is fully unit tested using TDD and is currently being hosted on Heroku.
- The database used to store user data and match results is using PostgreSQL
- A noSQL DynamoDB database is used to store the live match stat data.
- Websockets are used to send the live match data automatically to the user's device when the match is in-play.
- Scheduled AWS Lambda functions are used to automatically check if games are in-play and to retrieve the live data.
- A scheduled AWS Lambda function is also used to automatically call an API to update match results, as well as user scores.
- All match data is retrieved from an external API, the results are then used to compare against each user's predictions to assign points.
